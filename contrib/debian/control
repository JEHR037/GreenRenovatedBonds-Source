Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon
 GreenRenovatedBonds is an experimental new digital currency that enables anonymous, instant

 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. GreenRenovatedBonds Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.

 This package provides the daemon, greenrenovatedbondsd, and the CLI tool
 greenrenovatedbonds-cli to interact with the daemon.

 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
